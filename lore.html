	<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Origin / History</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">The continent of Astvinur has existed since prehistory. Its creation is undocumented, but the mythos of Astvinur states that 
			Astvinur was first settled by Elves, specifically the Elven Deity Correllon, who created high elves to watch over an ancient artifact. Since then,
			 war and migration of various races over its lands have caused shifts in its racial makeup.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Geography</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Astvinur's geography includes a frozen wasteland to the north, but little is known about it. There are also large plane-lands that are,
			 to the knowledge of most, desolate and unihabited. The midlands are flanked to the east by the Dragon's Trail Mountains, which also separate it from
			 the dangerous no-man's-land. This largely uninhabited midland is called The Wastes. To the west of the Wastes is the Witherwood. It was once verdant and
			 a safe place to travel and practice making trades, but the plague killed or cursed most of its wildlife, and some say, its trees. TO the south of the Wastes
			 lies the Sea of Tears, another place shrouded in mystery. The Orphaned Mountain sits at its center, an inexplicable island where goblins and other foul creatures
			 make their homes. South of the Sea of Tears are large swaths of lush forest. These extend to the peninsula and terminate at the coast of the Elder Sea. North of 
			 the peninsula is the Kordholm region where the largest city in the land was established. Many satelite towns and settlements dot the temperate zones of the continent.
			  Giraudus Isle is separated from the mainland by the Brigantian channel. Its waters rage from North to South, creating trouble for anyone who is not trained to 
			  navigate its currents. To the North of the contient is the island nation of Shalinar, home to the helflings. Shalinar's crater contains the ruins of several
			 sunken towns and cities.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Climate</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Most of Astvinur is temperate, though the Ghostfell, the Charred Valley, and the frozen wastelands are always said to retain their temperatures no matter
			 what the time of year. The wastes are generally cool to warm, the souther forests and the Kordholm region, as well as Giraudus Isle are generally temperate, and turn cooler
			 in the Winter months. Shalinar has a tropical climate, and enjoys that weather for most of the year, though they have to contend with the fierce currents plaguing
			 The Battered Ocean to their East, and the mainland's North.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Races</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Astvinurian races include predominantly humans. Dwarves and helflings are second and third respectively in population. There are lesser numbers of non-permanent residents
			 and travelers who are of other races. There are scattered numbers of colonies and nomad tribes of races that wander the lands as well.

	<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Origin / History</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Since time imemoriam, Amarna has been home to the yuan-ti. They originated from this place and have inhabited it since. From their 
			industry, rose many great kingdoms. Chief among these is Luxor, home to the Pharoah and his family. Other large cities include Najere and Aknoheten.
			Also native to this land is a population of Tabaxi, which have existed for a long time, though it is unknown when their establishing members arrived on
			 the continent. Some years ago, a strange portal opened up in the desert, through which the Giff appeared. They built their own settlement called Giffutania
			  where they reside in hopes of returning to their home planet. Until then, to satisfy their need for water, they constructed the Giff Pipeline. There is a 
			  constant conflict between the Giff and the Tabaxi over land rights.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Geography</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Amarna is almost entirely desert. It does includ the Tanis River, which runs East to West, bringing trade and travel opportunities to the citizens of the continent. 
			Similarly, tiny inlets called "The Fingers of Heaven" also bring in water from the south.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Climate</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Amarna is hot and arid year-round. The Tanis river does flood once a year, bringing in migrations of sea life over the land. This is the peak of 
			fishing season. The boraxian salt flats provide salt and borax, which is valuable to the rest of Oerth. The Dune Sea is composed of rolling sand dues that are very much
			 like a sea of water. If one is not careful, they could be buried in its merciless waves.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Races</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">The most predominant species is the Yuan-Ti, followed by Tabaxi, and then tied with humans are the Giff. Humans are not native to this land.</p>

	<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Origin / History</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">The mythological origin of Calabria begins with the Tree at the Center of the World, a place never visited by
			those who come from the surface. It is said that atop its branches, the leaves became the plates which form the crust of Oerth.
			Part of this mythology credits the island-nation of Calabria as the first land to come into being in this way. Since antiquity, 
			its peoples haven't been able to agree on how the world should be run. This resulted in its peoples splitting into various nations.
			Over time, they have created their own cultures, customs and languages. There is heavy prejudice between the peoples of these nations,
			and they frequently skirmish over landlines and water rights.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Geography</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Calabria is made up of islands and peninsulas.
		</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Climate</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Calabria is predominantly temperate. Merrovia has colder temperatures than the rest
			of the continent's regions, and sees heavy snowfall in winter. Illyria and Mysina enjoy tropical weather in summer and temperate weather
			for the rest of the year. Babylonia and the Astrashan Peninsula are hot and arid for the majority of the year.
			 The planes are dry and get lots of sun. Xhevahir and Acadia enjoy temperate weather year round.</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6>Races</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Calabrian races are mostly human and dragonborn. There are small constituencies of other races, including Yuan-ti and Tabaxi, but they are 
			not as prolific as others.</p>
		
		<div class="lorelabel"><h6 style="padding: 2px 0px 2px 0px; font-size: 1em;">Myths, Legends &#38; Heroes</h6></div>
		<p class="lore">Each country keeps their myths and legends largely secret, though the hero of Acadia, Zamenos, is said to have been immortal, still
			roming the world today.
