		<p class="proftxt">Hello there! I'm your friendly neighborhood Dungeon Master. I'm a 30-something mom of three little gremlins. I have always been creative, ever since I can remember. This has led to my pursuit of many hobbies and occupations. I'm a published author (in 2023, I will celebrate my 10th year of authorship). I've played the violin since I was 10, though I can't remark on whether I'm very good. I also play the viola and the cello. I like to compose music when the urge strikes. I dabble in photography and filmography. I enjoy watching old spaghetti westerns, and most of the common nerdy franchises. I don't typically watch much TV (don't ask me about Game of Thrones). I love gaming of many kinds, including games in the tabletop, video game, Massively Multiplayer and card game formats.<br>
		<br>
		My experience as a writer had a heavy hand in my style of dungeon mastering and character creation. I have always enjoyed writing and creating, so the storytelling aspect of being a dungeon master has come pretty easily to me. While I've had a lot of ideas for campaigns, I have only DM'd a full campaign once before. That campaign took my players about a year to complete and it was more of a railroad type, with clearly defined goals for the players. This approach worked for that group of players because most of them were new and inexperienced.<br>
		<br>
		I have played in three campaigns as a player, two of which were DM'd by my husband. I now DM for two groups that meet a few times a month.<br>
		There is a marked lack of people willing to dungeon master, but many who are willing to play. I hope that by opening up this campaign setting to others, it will encourage people interested in running games to do so.
